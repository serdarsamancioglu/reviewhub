# ReviewHub

ReviewHub is a simple Android app example which reads reviews from a JSON file, parses them into ReviewItems and lists them with ratings.

Clicking on a marker on an item shows the reviewer's location on map. 

To be able to use map, put your google API debug key into the file located at
src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml
