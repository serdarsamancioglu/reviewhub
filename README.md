# ReviewHub

ReviewHub is a simple Android app example which reads reviews from a JSON file, parses them into ReviewItems and lists them with ratings.

You can simply filter reviews by rating by selecting the desired rating from Rating Bar on top of the page.

Clicking on a marker on an item shows the reviewer's location on map. 

To be able to use map, put your google API debug key into the file located at
src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml
